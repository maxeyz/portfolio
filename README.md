### Bobby

- **About**
  - "Bobby" is the result of six weeks of work from third-year game programming and art students at Luleå University of Technology (LTU). Bobby is a vertical slice of a stop-motion mystery game created in UE5 and is set in a small town, evocative of early 1900s London. The narrative centers on a bedridden girl whose sister has been missing for several weeks. Desperate to find her sister but unable to leave her bed, the girl imagines her favorite toy, Bobby the toy police officer, embarking on the search in her stead. Although Bobby isn't truly alive, he embodies the girl’s fervent hope that someone will find her sister.

    In the game, players control Bobby as he explores the town, gathering clues about the sister's disappearance. During his investigation, Bobby uncovers evidence of some kind of creature. Thinking that this creature might have something to do with the sister's disappearance, he follows the trail of clues in hope that he might uncover the truth.

- **My Role**
  - I worked mainly in a small group of 2 other programers and 3 artists. Our job was to implement the town square where the boss fight takes place, as well as implement the fight itself. I worked both on the tentacles and the small minion creatures that spawns during the fight. I was responsible for creating an FSM for both along with making functionable states, and sole programer for the minions behavior. We were using a mix of Perforce, Helix Swarm, and Hansoft as tools for planning and were using Angelscript as our programing language.
 
### Turn the Tide

- **About**
  - "Turn the Tide" was the first game I ever created during my first year at LTU. There were three other people that worked on it and we finished it within roughly four weeks. Turn the Tide is a two player, turn-based game focusing on strategy which takes place in the waters of caribbean. Control a pirate ship to naviage the waters and collect treassures which will reward them with power-ups in the form of cards to either aid them in battle or utility to cover the field more efficiently. The cards can be used in combination with the basic navigation to ensure you get in the perfect spot before using the power-up. The last one standing wins!
 
- **My Role**
  - I was working on a bit of everything during this project. Implementing the movement, shooting, map generation, and some power ups. We worked using Github and Unity as our main tools, and just MS Paint for the UI art. The assets were not created by us, but downloaded from Kenney with the exception of the UI.
